  - To protect users from potential phishing attacks, the wallet will now block connections to suspicious websites during wallet access and transaction signing.
3. Blacklist Address Blocking
  - Transactions containing addresses on the blacklist will be blocked during the signing process to prevent potential security risks.
4. Risk Warning on Transaction Signing Exceptions
  - Users will receive a risk warning if any abnormal behavior is detected while signing transactions. Currently, abnormal behavior is identified by the loss of plaintext.
